# UFOs

## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to learn how to use data stored as a JavaScript array or list and create a table to hold the info that will visually adjust with different filters. Using JavaScript functions to loop through the data in order to build the table and to create customized dashboard. These customizations include different filters with event listeners that will record the info when an element has changed and develope an interactive webpage. Using HTML, Bootstrap and CSS to read the JavaScript code to create a webpage that can be easily viewed with filters, images, and some info about the topic at hand.

## Results

The following image is a screenshot of said webpage including a Filter search and a data table with the relevant data showing.

## Summary

### Drawback

The page has many drawbacks one being that the search field is "case-sensitive" and the table will not update if what is typed in the search bar matches exactly with the data. Also doesn't allow for partial entries.

### Recommendations

A couple of recommendations to help enhance the webpage is to add additional customizables like a button to click, auto-fill, drop-down list, etc. and to have the data for the webpage to extract from a live source inorder to update the table with new info.
